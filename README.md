### What is MS?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease. In a healthy body, the immune system sends white blood cells to fight invaders, such as bacteria. An immune-mediated disease is when the immune system attacks the healthy cells of your body. 

In MS, the immune system attacks the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Over time, the immune system wears down the protective cover on the nerves, called myelin. This damage is called sclerosis. This damage results in the symptoms of MS, such as pain, loss of brain function, and loss of mobility. Over time, these symptoms can affect other aspects of life.

### What is ONE?

Instead of just making a simple App for a small, singular purpose for people with MS, we felt strongly about building a platform with various functions, combining what was available with today’s technology. 

According to our teammate who graduated from medical school at Northeastern University,  
MS affects a patient’s independence in various ways. The most frequently reported impairments in MS are:
- Two thirds of patients report trouble walking. 
- 94% say mobility impairment interrupts their overall daily life. 
- 70% of people with mobility impairment say it is the most challenging aspect of MS.
- Cause of mobility changes, 
- Fatigue (tiredness),
- Decreased coordination,
- Paralysis, 
- Sensory loss,
- Visual problems,
- Weakness,
- Tingling/numbness,
- Urinary incontinence,
- Spasticity/ stiffness,
- Cognitive deficits...

The list goes on and on. A single focused app does little to help a person with MS, so we created One, which acts as a centralized platform with the most important resources for a person living with MS. We built this platform because we hope that people with MS can easily gain great and useful functions instead of downloading 20 different apps from developers. 

One plans to include six key functions for users, but first and foremost, we wanted to build a community where people with MS could help each other with tips and personal experiences. The community platform provides useful functions for everyday life while living with MS.

We built a meditation function where a person with MS can visit the page, clear his or her head, get rid of any distractions, and relax while listening to classical music. The meditation prototype provides a timer option where users can select the amount of time to take a break from their everyday life and mellow down and relax. 

A centralized platform like One would not be a platform without an emergency function for accidents. The emergency function allows the user to store contacts to notify if any problems happen. For example, a person living with MS could fall on ice during the winter. Jumbling for your phone and finding the right contact wastes time. Having one button to contact a list of family members with a simple message including providing your location on a unique URL will help in emergencies. 
The last prototype function that we developed includes a hardware solution for precise and mechanical tasks. Inspired by Estimote, we saw a convenient solution through NFC card scanners to perform automated tasks. An example is sometimes, fumbling for your keys to get inside your house after a long day can be tiring, annoying, and stressful. With a small NFC tag to keep in your wallet or even using your phone as the NFC device, you tap on your door to open it automatically. Other functions that we planned on integrating included a schedule application to manage the day, but we only had enough time to develop for three.

One provides this unified platform where people living with MS can find the right community and tools for their stress relief, automation, and schedule needs.
